## SECTION B


### Introduction


We plan to use image processing and machine learning as the main areas for our project. The system we create will take a photo of a building or landmark in real-time and compare that it to other photos in a database, when a match is found the system will display information about the site.


### Outline


For our project we plan to create an image recognition system for buildings where a user can take a photo of a building or landmark, our system will then identify what building it is by searching through a database of photos. The system will then display information relevant to the building, eg. the address, why is was constructed and any historical data. 

This system will be built into an android app. The app will also contain several routes to notable buildings/landmarks which can be used by the user as a tour.

### Background


We decided on this idea for our project when we realised there isn't any apps for tourists to use around Dublin. Tourists in Dublin have to pay for the hop-on hop-off bus tour or walk around themselves not really knowing where to go if they want to explore different places in the city. Our app would guide these tourists to different sites and show them all the information they need about the site.

### Achievements


Our project will provide a much needed app to help modernise the tourist world. The only apps designed for tourists are for finding flights and places to stay, there is nothing for them to use once they get to their destination. Although the main target audience is tourists, the app could also be used by people with impaired vision, students or anyone that wants to educate themselves further on their local sites.

### Justification

We believe this application is justified as it will be used by tourists as well as local people to the area who are curious about their surroundings. The application looks to modernise the world of tourism and general awareness, particularly in large cities. The application also looks to help those who may have difficulties navigating large and complex cities due to specific disabilities.

### Programming language(s)


Python

React/Javascript

Java


### Programming tools / Tech stack


Google cloud platform

Flask

Android

Pycharm

### Hardware

Smartphone


### Learning Challenges

The full development of an application on a smartphone will be a new challenge that we have not faced before, the technologies behind this such as React and Javascript will also be difficult challenge as we have not worked in these areas before. The creation and hosting a large dataset is another challenge we look forward to facing, we intend to use Google Cloud to host a large majority of our dataset. We intend to use python to develop the computer vision section of our project, although we are comfortable with using python we have not used it in regards to convoluted neural networks or image processing before. The hosting of our neaural network and application will also be a challenge for us. We intend to use flask for a majority of this section as we have used this technology in previous areas of similar projects. However, we have not used flask in a smartphone application before.

### Breakdown of work

Both students will be involved in the testing phase. We plan to use PyUnit for unit testing and appium to test the mobile app.

#### Student 1

Student 1 will undertake the development and implementation of the smartphone application. This section will include using React and Javascript to create a GUI that is clear and easy to use. This student will also manage the hosting of the application on Flask. This will involve linking and implementing the existing neural network and computer vision section into the application. 

#### Student 2

Student 2 will undertake the development of the computer vision and machine learning sections of the project. This includes development and hosting of large datasets of images on Google Cloud. The development and training of the convoluted neural network to predict what building is in a certain image. This involves using image processing techniques in python using libraries such as Open CV
