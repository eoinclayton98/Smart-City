## Smart-City

Smart City is an application based around the tourism industry. The smartphone based application can operate on both Android and iOS systems with the use of expo, this is a clear advantage in the current technology climate. The application has several features to allow a person to explore a new city. 

One feature allows a user to submit a photo and have the system automatically predict what landmark it is, the app will then return the name, a description and links to relevant websites relating to the landmark.

The app also has several predesigned routes in which the user can choose between and have this route mapped out on google maps.

The last feature is a built in map which displays all the landmarks compatible with the app along with the users location. The user can use this map to see where they are in relation to landmarks nearby.
